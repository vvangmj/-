# Single-cycle CPU design based on MIPS instruction set
Component Organization and Architecture Laboratory
design a simple single cycle CPU using verilog

language：verilog
environment：iverilog


In “cpu.rar”：
the code of single-cycle cpu. 
Exper10.v compose all parts of cpu. 
TestBench realize the implementation of cpu

In “program.rar”：
The code of several unit experiment, the corresponding experiment reports are in “report.rar”

In “report.rar”：
All of the experiment report including final task.
